    "### CoxPH model\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Cox Proportional Hazards model (CoxPH)** is one of the most widely used methods for **survival analysis**.  \n",
    "It models the relationship between the **time until an event occurs** (e.g., death) and a set of **covariates** (e.g., clinical, genetic).\n",
    "\n",
    "CoxPH is **semi-parametric**:  \n",
    "- It does **not assume any specific form** for the underlying survival time distribution.  \n",
    "- It **parametrically models** the influence of covariates on the event risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The model expresses the **hazard function** — the instantaneous risk of experiencing the event at time *t* given survival up to *t* — as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h(t | x) = h_0(t) \\, \\exp(\\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p x_p)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:  \n",
    "- $h_0(t)$ — baseline hazard function (shared across all individuals)  \n",
    "- $\\beta_i$ — coefficients representing the effect of each covariate $x_i$  \n",
    "- $\\exp(\\beta_i)$ — hazard ratio (HR), indicating how a one-unit change in $x_i$ affects the risk\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If $\\exp(\\beta_i) > 1$: the covariate **increases the hazard** (reduces survival).  \n",
    "    - If $\\exp(\\beta_i) < 1$: the covariate **reduces the hazard** (improves survival).  \n",
    "    - If $\\exp(\\beta_i) = 1$: the covariate **has no effect** on the hazard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Assumption: Proportional Hazards\n",
    "\n",
    "The defining assumption of the Cox model is that the **hazard ratios between individuals remain constant over time**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{h(t | x_1)}{h(t | x_2)} = \\exp(\\beta^\\top (x_1 - x_2))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that covariates shift the hazard proportionally but do not change its shape over time.  \n",
    "If this assumption is violated, model estimates may be unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameter Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cox proposed the **partial likelihood** approach, which allows estimation of coefficients $\\beta$ without specifying the baseline hazard $h_0(t)$.  \n",
    "This makes the model computationally efficient and robust for high-dimensional biological or clinical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Typical Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "A fitted CoxPH model typically provides:\n",
    "- Estimated coefficients $\\beta_i$ and hazard ratios $\\exp(\\beta_i)$  \n",
    "- Significance tests (z-scores, p-values)  \n",
    "- Model performance metrics such as the **Concordance Index (C-index)**  \n",
    "- Diagnostic checks for proportional hazards assumptions\n"
