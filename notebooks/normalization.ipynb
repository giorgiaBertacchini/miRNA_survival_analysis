    "Various factors affect transcript quantification in RNA-seq data, such as sequencing depth, transcript length, and sample-to-sample and batch-to-batch variability. Normalization methods exist to minimize these variables and ensure reliable transcriptomic data. Sequencing technologies introduce technical variability. Therefore, raw transcriptomic data must be adjusted to account for these technical factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to choose the correct RNA-seq normalization method for the dataset and there are three main RNA-seq normalization stages to consider:\n",
    " 1. **Within sample**: Within sample normalization is required to compare the expression of genes within an individual sample. It can adjust data for two primary technical variables: transcript length and sequencing depth. Longer genes often have more mapped reads than shorter genes at the same expression level. Therefore, their expression level can only be accurately compared within a sample after normalization. Furthermore, the number of sequencing reads per sample may vary. This can also be corrected by within sample normalization. Within sample normalization is not sufficient to compare gene expression between samples. For this, between sample RNA-seq normalization methods are required. Within sample normalization most common techniques are:\n",
    "    - **CPM**: Counts per million (CPM) mapped reads are the number of raw reads mapped to a transcript, scaled by the number of sequencing reads in your sample, multiplied by a million. It normalizes RNA-seq data for sequencing depth but not gene length. Therefore, although it is a within sample normalization approach, CPM normalization is unsuitable for within sample comparisons of gene expression. Between sample comparisons can be made when CPM is used alongside ‘within a dataset’ normalization methods.\n",
    "    - **FPKM/RPKM**: FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped) for paired-end data and RPKM (reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped) for single-end data correct for variations in library size and gene length. One issue with FPKM/RPKM units is that the expression of a gene in one sample will appear different from its expression in another sample, even when its true expression level is the same. This is because it depends on the relative abundance of a transcript among a population of sequenced transcripts. FPKM/RPKM units best compare gene expression within a single sample\n",
    "    - **TPM**: Transcripts per million (TPM) represents the relative number of transcripts you would detect for a gene if you had sequenced one million full-length transcripts. It is calculated by dividing the number of reads mapped to a transcript by the transcript length. This value is then divided by the sum of mapped reads to all transcripts after normalization for transcript length. It is then multiplied by one million to allow easier further analyses. It normalizes RNA-seq data for sequencing depth and transcript length. TPM and FPKM/RPKM are closely related, however, in contrast to FPKM/RPKM, there is limited variation in values between samples as the sum of all TPMs in each sample is the same. TPM can be used for within sample comparisons but requires ‘within a dataset’ normalization for between sample comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Within a dataset (between samples)**: Samples within a dataset can be simultaneously normalized as a complete set to adjust for different technical variations such as sequencing depth. RNA-seq is a relative, not an absolute, measure of transcript abundance. This means that the transcript population as a whole affects relative levels of transcripts. This creates biases for gene expression analyses, and these are minimized by between sample RNA-seq normalization methods. Within a dataset normalization mosto common techniques are:\n",
    "    - **Quantile**: The quantile method aims to make the distribution of gene expression levels the same for each sample in a dataset. It assumes that the global differences in distributions between samples are all due to technical variation. Any remaining differences are likely actual biological effects. For each sample, genes are ranked based on their expression level. An average value is calculated across all samples for genes of the same rank. This average value then replaces the original value of all genes in that rank. These genes are then placed in their original order.\n",
    "    - **TMM**: TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) also assumes that most genes are not differentially expressed between samples. If many genes are uniquely or highly expressed in one experimental condition, it will affect the accurate quantification of the remaining genes. To adjust for this possibility, TMM calculates scaling factors to adjust library sizes for the normalization of samples within a dataset. To do this, one sample is chosen as a reference sample. The fold changes and absolute expression levels of other samples within the dataset are then calculated relative to the reference sample. Next, the genes in the data set are ‘trimmed’ to remove differentially expressed genes using these two values. The trimmed mean of the fold changes is then found for each sample. Finally, read counts are scaled by this trimmed mean and the total count of their sample.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. **Across datasets**: Researchers often integrate RNA-seq data from multiple independent studies. These datasets are usually sequenced at different times, with varying methods across multiple facilities, and contain other experimental variables. This results in a batch effect. The batch effect is often responsible for the greatest source of differential expression when data is combined. It can mask any true biological differences and lead to incorrect conclusions. RNA-seq normalization across datasets can correct for known variables across batches, such as the sequencing center and date of sequencing, as well as unknown variables.\n",

    "Since we want to have a model capable of inferring the survivability of a patient given a feature vector, we thought that the model would need, to behave at best, data normalized across the dataset allowing intra-dataset comparisons in order to learn when a feature vector corresponds to higher or lower survivability. Given this preposition we first normalize miRNA read values with the TMM method to allow genetic intra-dataset comparisons, and then normalize all values of the feature vectors."
